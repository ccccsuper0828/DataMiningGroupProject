# Data Mining Group Project - Energy Consumption Analysis

This repository contains a data mining project focused on analyzing energy consumption data from the "Data Server Energy Consumption Dataset" (DOI: 10.21227/x6jw-m015). The dataset, sampled at 1 Hz from May to December 2021, includes datetime columns (`fecha_servidor`, `fecha_esp32`) and various energy metrics (e.g., `Voltage`, `Active_Power`). The project involves data preprocessing, missing data checking, and CSV file splitting for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
